I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Electrical & Computer Engineering Department at the University of Washington, advised by [Baosen Zhang](https://zhangbaosen.github.io/). My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, power systems, and game theory. I also support the data science initiatives at <a href="https://www.shiftedenergy.com/" target="_blank">Shifted Energy</a> on a part-time basis.
