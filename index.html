bio: I am currently on a leave of absence from my Ph.D. program in the Electrical & Computer Engineering Department at the University of Washington, where I was advised by <a href="https://zhangbaosen.github.io/" target="_blank">Baosen Zhang</a>. During this time, I am immersing myself in AIâ€”learning from it, improving it, and one maybe day merging with it ðŸ¤–. My previous research interests focused on the intersection of machine learning, power systems, and game theory. I also support the data science initiatives at <a href="https://www.shiftedenergy.com/" target="_blank">Shifted Energy</a> on a part-time basis.
