Handling streaming data with seasonal or cyclic patterns is a common task in data science and machine learning. In this blog post, we discuss a simple implementation of a seasonal uniform average that serves as a solid baseline for forecasting problems with cyclical patterns of a known cycle length. We conclude this blog post with a case study from the NeurIPS 2023 CityLearn Challenge, where this method outperformed 75% of the more complex machine learning models.


## Motivation

When dealing with streaming data, it is important to have a method that can efficiently update the model. Online algorithms process data incrementally, reducing memory requirements and making the calculations more efficient. The seasonal uniform average is an online algorithm that uses an incremental formula to calculate a uniformly weighted average of the data points. 

The seasonal uniform average offers a key advantage: simplicity.

* It effectively mitigates the cold start problem, where limited data can lead complex models to overfit. For instance, an online retailer must predict a new userâ€™s likelihood to purchase without prior preferences. This method avoids overfitting by leveraging its straightforward approach.
* Its simplicity enhances explainability, making it easy to modify and improve.
* A quick, reliable baseline is crucial for evaluating model performance, and the seasonal uniform average provides a clear, straightforward benchmark.


## Implementation
In this section, we will create a simple Python class for the seasonal uniform average. This class is designed to continually update and maintain a running average for each seasonal index in a cyclic dataset. 

```python
class SeasonalUniformAverager:

    def __init__(self, n=24):
        self.n = n
        self.values = np.zeros(n, np.float32)
        self.counts = np.ones(n, np.int32)
        self.time_index = 0

    def update(self, x):
        idx = self.time_index % self.n # seasonal index
        update_value = (x - self.values[idx]) / self.counts[idx]
        self.values[idx] += update_value
        self.counts[idx] += 1
        self.time_index += 1
    
    def predict(self, time_indices):
        return self.values[time_indices % self.n]    
```
The class is set up with a specified cycle length, `n`, and maintains two arrays: `values` to store the running averages and `counts` to track the number of updates for each seasonal index. A `time_index` is utilized to keep track of the overall time progression. The `update` method takes a new data point, `x`, and updates the running average for the current seasonal index, which is determined by `self.time_index % self.n`. This cyclic indexing ensures that the running averages are updated in a seasonal manner, cycling back to the first index after reaching the end of the cycle. The `predict` method returns the current running averages for a provided array of seasonal indices. 

## Mathematical Foundation
We can use mathematical induction to prove that the incremental formula calculates the uniform average. In our implementation, use this fact `n` times--one for each seasonal index--however, here will only show it for a single seasonal index. Let $$\bar{x}_k = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k x_i$$ represent the average after $ k $ data points. 

### Base Case ($ k = 1 $):
For the first data point, the incremental formula yields $$ \bar{x}_1 = x_1 $$. The batch formula also yields: $$ \frac{1}{1} \sum_{i=1}^1 x_i = x_1 $$. So the formula holds for $ k = 1 $.

### Inductive Step:
Assume the formula holds for some $ k $, i.e., $$ \bar{x}_k = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k x_i $$. Now, we need to show that the formula also holds for $ k + 1 $.

When the $ (k+1) $-th data point $ x_{k+1} $ arrives, the incremental formula updates the average as follows:

$$ \bar{x}_{k+1} = \bar{x}_k + \left( x_{k+1} - \bar{x}_k \right) / (k + 1). $$

Now, substitute the inductive hypothesis into the equation above:

$$ \bar{x}_{k+1} =  \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k x_i + \left( x_{k+1} -  \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k x_i  \right) \frac{1}{k+1}. $$

Multiply the first term by $ (k + 1) / (k + 1) $ and simplify the expression:

$$ 
\bar{x}_{k+1} 
     = \frac{1}{k+1} \left( \frac{k+1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k x_i  +  x_{k+1} -  \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k x_i \right) 
    = \frac{1}{k+1} \sum_{i=1}^{k+1} x_i.
$$

The formula holds for $ k + 1 $ given it holds for $ k $. Thus, by induction, the incremental formula computes the same uniform average as the batch formula. 


## Improvements

The current implementation can be improved in several ways
* by incorporating a prior value which can bias the average and reduce the variance in the estimate. 
* If your data exhibits multiple types of seasonality, a simple solution is to combine multiple seasonal uniform averages to create a single forecast. 
* If the data is non-stationary, then this approach will not work well; a potential improvement is to add a trend to the forecast or to use an exponentially weighted moving average (although the forecast will tend to lag the actual values).  


## Case Study: NeurIPS 2023 CityLearn Challenge
The efficacy of the seasonal uniform average was put to the test in the <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2023-citylearn-challenge/problems/forecasting-track-citylearn-challenge" target="_blank">NeurIPS 2023 CityLearn Challenge</a>. In this challenge, participants were tasked with developing models to forecast energy demand in a simulated urban environment. The cyclical nature of energy demand over the course of a day presented an ideal scenario for employing the seasonal uniform average.

Remarkably, the straightforward approach of employing a seasonal uniform average outpaced 75% of the more complex machine learning models submitted to the challenge. This not only underscores the effectiveness of the seasonal uniform average but also highlights the importance of establishing a strong, simple baseline before venturing into more complex modeling techniques.


## Conclusion
The seasonal uniform average is a valuable method for data scientists and machine learning engineers when dealing with seasonal or cyclic data streams with a known cycle length. As demonstrated in the NeurIPS 2023 CityLearn Challenge, a simple, well-thought-out approach can yield results that rival or surpass those obtained with more complex methodologies. The seasonal uniform average stands as a strong starting point for anyone looking to get into the analysis and forecasting of cyclic data.
