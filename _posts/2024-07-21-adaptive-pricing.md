Adaptive pricing is a technique for dynamically adjusting prices to maximize revenue. The technique is particularly useful in settings where the demand for a product is unknown and varies over time. In this post, I'll discuss the theory behind adaptive pricing and provide a simple implementation.

<!-- ## Theory

The theory behind adaptive pricing is based on the concept of price elasticity of demand. Price elasticity of demand is a measure of how responsive the quantity demanded of a good is to a change in its price. It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.

$$ \text{Price Elasticity of Demand} = \frac{\% \text{ Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\% \text{ Change in Price}} $$

If the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, then the demand is said to be elastic. This means that a small change in price will result in a large change in quantity demanded. If the price elasticity of demand is less than 1, then the demand is said to be inelastic. This means that a small change in price will result in a small change in quantity demanded.

## Implementation

The implementation of adaptive pricing involves the following steps:

1. Set an initial price
2. Observe the demand at that price
3. Adjust the price based on the observed demand
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3

The key to adaptive pricing is the algorithm used to adjust the price in step 3. There are many different algorithms that can be used, but one simple approach is to use a gradient descent algorithm. The gradient descent algorithm adjusts the price in the direction that is expected to increase revenue.

$$ \text{Revenue} = \text{Price} \times \text{Quantity Demanded} $$

$$ \frac{\partial \text{Revenue}}{\partial \text{Price}} = \text{Quantity Demanded} + \text{Price} \times \frac{\partial \text{Quantity Demanded}}{\partial \text{Price}} $$

The gradient descent algorithm adjusts the price in the direction of the gradient of the revenue function.

$$ \text{Price}_{t+1} = \text{Price}_t + \alpha \times \frac{\partial \text{Revenue}}{\partial \text{Price}} $$

where $\alpha$ is the learning rate.

## Conclusion

Adaptive pricing is a powerful technique for maximizing revenue in settings where the demand for a product is unknown and varies over time. By dynamically adjusting prices based on observed demand, adaptive pricing can help businesses optimize their pricing strategies.  -->
