This post supplements [our paper](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=fOWhQ3AAAAAJ&citation_for_view=fOWhQ3AAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC) on coordinating agent behavior using adaptive pricing. I believe the best way to understand this concept is through an animation of the iterative process â€“ it still surprises whenever I see it.

## Introduction to Adaptive Pricing

Adaptive pricing is a mechanism for coordinating the behavior of multiple agents in a system to achieve a socially optimal outcome. The key idea is to iteratively adjust prices based on the agents' responses, guiding them toward behaviors that benefit the entire system.

## How It Works

1. The system starts with an initial set of prices
2. Agents optimize their behavior based on these prices
3. The system observes the collective behavior and adjusts prices
4. This process repeats until convergence

The beauty of this approach is that it doesn't require agents to share their private information or preferences. Each agent simply responds to the current prices according to their own objectives.

## Applications in Energy Systems

In energy systems, adaptive pricing can be used to coordinate the charging and discharging of batteries, the operation of flexible loads, and the dispatch of distributed energy resources. By properly designing the pricing mechanism, we can ensure that the system operates efficiently while respecting the autonomy of individual agents.

## Visualization

The animation below shows how adaptive pricing works in a simple system with multiple agents. Each agent has its own objective function and constraints, but through the iterative adjustment of prices, they collectively converge to a solution that is optimal for the entire system.

## Conclusion

Adaptive pricing provides a powerful framework for coordinating decentralized decision-making in complex systems. By leveraging economic principles, we can design mechanisms that align individual incentives with system-wide objectives, leading to more efficient and sustainable outcomes.
