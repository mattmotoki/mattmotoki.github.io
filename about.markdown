I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Electrical & Computer Engineering Department at the University of Washington, advised by [Baosen Zhang](https://zhangbaosen.github.io/). My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, power systems, and sustainability.

## Research Focus

My research focuses on developing machine learning algorithms for energy systems, with a particular emphasis on:

- Reinforcement learning for energy management
- Time series forecasting for energy demand and generation
- Coordination mechanisms for distributed energy resources

## Professional Experience

In addition to my doctoral studies, I lead the data science efforts at [Shifted Energy](https://www.shiftedenergy.com/), where we develop technology to transform electric water heaters into grid-interactive assets.

## Competitions

I enjoy participating in machine learning competitions in my free time. I am a [competitions grandmaster](https://www.kaggle.com/mmotoki) on Kaggle and have won several energy-related competitions, including:

- 1st place in the 2019 Great Energy Predictor III
- 1st place in the 2023 NeurIPS CityLearn Challenge (Forecasting Track)
- 2nd place in the 2022 NeurIPS CityLearn Challenge
