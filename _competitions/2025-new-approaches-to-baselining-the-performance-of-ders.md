This competition, organized by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), challenges participants to develop reliable methodologies for baselining the performance of aggregated Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) to improve grid reliability, economic efficiency, and stakeholder benefits. My solution introduces a fair and scalable approach by dynamically rotating DERs between active and baseline groups, reducing bias and preventing manipulation. It also incorporates smart incentives to ensure accurate reporting and discourage gaming the system. By making DER baselining more reliable, fair, and adaptable, this approach supports better integration of DERs into the grid.
