This creative coding project visualizes the heat diffusion process in a one-dimensional rod. The animation shows how heat spreads through the material over time, with colors representing temperature variations. This visualization demonstrates fundamental principles of thermodynamics and partial differential equations in an interactive and visually engaging way.
