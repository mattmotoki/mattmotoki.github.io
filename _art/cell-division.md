This creative coding project is a strategy-based board game inspired by cellular biology. Players take turns placing cells on the board, and when cells connect with each other, they divide and multiply. The game features an AI opponent and keeps score based on the total number of cells each player controls. The game ends when the board is full, with the winner being the player who has the most cells.

## How to Play

1. Click on an empty space to place your cell
2. When your cells connect with other cells, they divide and multiply
3. The AI opponent will take its turn automatically
4. The game ends when the board is full
5. The player with the most cells wins
