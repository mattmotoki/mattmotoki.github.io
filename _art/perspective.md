description: "Visualizes the intersection of 2D planes in 3D space with a perspective transformation."
---


This creative coding project explores perspective transformations in 3D space. The visualization demonstrates how 2D planes appear when viewed from different angles in a 3D environment, creating an illusion of depth and dimension. The project helps illustrate fundamental concepts of computer graphics and spatial geometry through an interactive visual experience.

## Features

- Interactive 3D visualization
- Perspective transformation of 2D planes
- Dynamic viewing angles
- Real-time rendering
