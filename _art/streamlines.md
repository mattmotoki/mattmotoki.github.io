This creative coding project creates a dynamic visualization of flow fields using streamlines. The animation shows particles moving through a vector field, creating mesmerizing patterns as they follow the underlying mathematical currents. The result is both aesthetically pleasing and informative, offering insight into how particles behave in complex flow systems.
