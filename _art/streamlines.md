This creative coding project visualizes a vector field using streamlines. Particles move through the field following the flow direction at each point, creating beautiful patterns that reveal the underlying structure of the field.

## Technical Implementation

- Vector field mathematics for particle movement
- Dynamic flow visualization techniques
- Particle system with thousands of individual elements
- Color mapping based on velocity and position
