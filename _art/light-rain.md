description: "Semi-transparent rectangles with colors determined by Perlin noise."
---

This creative coding project creates a gentle rain-like visual effect using semi-transparent rectangles. The colors and positions of the rectangles are determined by Perlin noise, creating a natural, organic flow that resembles light rain against a window.

## Technical Aspects

- Perlin noise algorithm for natural randomness
- Semi-transparent layering for depth
- Subtle color variations based on position
- Gentle animation mimicking rainfall patterns
