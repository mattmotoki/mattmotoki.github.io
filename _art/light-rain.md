This creative coding project simulates a gentle rain effect using semi-transparent rectangles. The colors and positions of the rectangles are determined by Perlin noise algorithms, creating a natural, organic feel to the movement and appearance. The result is a soothing, ambient visualization that evokes the peaceful atmosphere of light rainfall.
