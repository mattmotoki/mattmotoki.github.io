This creative coding project uses Delaunay triangulation to create an abstract geometric pattern. The algorithm generates a set of points and connects them to form triangles that satisfy the Delaunay condition, resulting in a visually pleasing mesh.

## About Delaunay Triangulation

Delaunay triangulation is a mathematical technique that maximizes the minimum angle of all triangles in a mesh. This creates a more aesthetically pleasing and structurally sound triangulation compared to other methods. The technique is widely used in computer graphics, computational geometry, and digital art.
