# Fractal Tree

**Autumnal, branching fractal tree with recursive patterns.**

This creative coding project generates a fractal tree with autumn-inspired colors. The algorithm uses recursive branching patterns to create a natural-looking tree structure, with each branch splitting into smaller branches at varying angles.

## How It Works

The tree is generated using a recursive algorithm:
1. Start with a trunk
2. Split into branches at the end of the trunk
3. Each branch splits into smaller branches
4. The process repeats until a minimum branch size is reached
5. Colors are applied to create an autumnal appearance
